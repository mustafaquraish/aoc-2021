# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

## Input

All the inputs should be placed in the `input/` directory, with the name of the day (with 2 digits), such as `input/01.txt` or `input/13.txt`.

## Python

Run solution for day `N` with `python3 python/N.py`

## C

Compile solution for day `N` with `gcc c/N.c`. A little script called `run.sh` is provided in the root of the repo that compiles and runs a particular solution, use as `./run.sh 07`.

## Templates

Default templates for C/Python are in the corresponding directories, the included `new.sh` script takes in a day number and makes a copy of the template / blank input files for you.
